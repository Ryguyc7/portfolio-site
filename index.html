        Hello, my name is Ryan Crahan. I'm a passionate and driven computer science student currently pursuing my degree at 
        Wentworth Institute of Technology. At 21 years old, I’ve already learned many skills that span across several creative 
        and technical areas, including software development, 3D modeling, user interface (UI) design, video editing, and web 
        development.<br><br>
        Over the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of Unity-based projects that allowed me to integrate 
        my love for coding with my visual design skills. These projects not only helped my ability to create immersive digital experiences 
        but also enhanced my understanding of game mechanics, interactive design, and performance optimization. Recently, I successfully 
        launched my first mobile game on the App Store, as well as a fully functioning website. This has taught me the process of app 
        and web production, from concept to publication.<br><br>
        In addition to game development, I’ve explored monetization strategies through platforms such as AdSense and Unity Ads, gaining 
        knowledge in revenue generation. My recent work has also involved Firebase integration, which helped me develop a stronger grasp 
        of backend development, database management, and user authentication systems. I continue to seek out new challenges and learning 
        opportunities that allow me to grow as a developer and designer in both the mobile and web spaces.
